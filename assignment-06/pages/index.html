            <h3><b>WARNING:</b></h3>
            <i>If a Follower goes several days without eating, they will gain the Starving status. The Starvation meter over their head will slowly fill; if it turns completely red, the Follower dies immediately. Starving Followers have the status removed as soon as they eat a meal of any kind.</i>

        <p>Hungry Followers will stop what they are doing and eat a meal if one is available. Meals are given to the hungriest Followers first, and the Flock is smart enough that multiple Followers won't try to eat the same meal. The exception to this is if a Follower has requested a specific meal as part of a quest; in these cases, that Follower skips the line and eats the first plate of the requested meal that is cooked.

        <p><h4>Some helpful ingridents when making meals for your followers include:</h4>
