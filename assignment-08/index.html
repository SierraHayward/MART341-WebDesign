        <h2><span class="header">Lyrics</span></h2>
            <p>You taught me the courage of stars before you left </br>
            How light carries on endlessly, even after death </br>
            With shortness of breath </br>
            You explained the infinite </br>
            And how rare and beautiful it is to even exist</p>

            <p>I couldn't help but ask for you to say it all again </br>
            I tried to write it down, but I could never find a pen </br>
            I'd give anything to hear you say it one more time </br>
            That the universe was made just to be seen by my eyes</p>

            And how rare and beautiful it truly is that we exist</p>
