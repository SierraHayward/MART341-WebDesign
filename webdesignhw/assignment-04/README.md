1. Explain how web browsers function
    Web browsers are how people access the internet. The brower reaches out to a specific server and recieves web content in return and interpets that information into a website for the user to view.

2. Define and describe DOM
    The DOM is the document object model. It determines how the browser interpets and access the content of a document by displaying it in a way programming languages like JavaScript can modify.

3. What is the difference between HTML XML and XHTML? 
    HTML displays document nodes, XML describes document nodes and XHTML is the bridge that combines the two so they operate with as little error as possible.

4. What are the 4 elements your HTML pages need? 
    The document type element <!DOCTYPE html>
    The root element <html> </html>
    The head element <head> </head>
    And the body element <body> </body>

5. What is the index.html page for? Where does it go? 
    The index.html page is the master HTML file for a site. It goes at the top of a directory tree.

6. Review: What are some of the best naming practices?
    - Root folder should contain anything directly related to the website (logo, buisness cards, etc. should go elsewhere)
    - homepage always has to be named index.html or index.htm
    - no spaces and no funky characters on ANY file names, avoid using numeric numbers at the beginning of file names, make sure to always include extensions
    - Pages folder should have subpages, subpages names should be unique to the contents of that page
    - Images folder should contain images, CSS folder should contain CSS, Scripts folder should contain scripts
